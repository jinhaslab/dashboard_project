The original document of GPT-3 addin is https://github.com/MichelNivard/gptstudio. Please visit the detail options and tutorial. <br>
 In this step,  here is a summary of the steps to add GPT-3 to Rstudio:

1. Make an OpenAI account and create an API key.
2. Set the API key in Rstudio either globally or for a specific project.
3. Install the openai package and the gptstudio add-in from GitHub.
4. Start a GPT chat in Rstudio by using the add-in or by using the openai package.

It's important to keep in mind that using these tools involves sending text or code to OpenAI, so it's important to be aware of what data is being shared and to take steps to protect sensitive information.


## Make an OpenAI API key

> API
 
 API stands for Application Programming Interface. An API is a set of protocols, routines, and tools for building software and applications. It specifies how software components should interact and APIs allow for communication between different systems.

In the context of web development, an API defines a set of rules for accessing a web-based software application or web tool. An API is implemented by a server and can be consumed by a client. The client sends a request to the API, and the API sends a response back to the client. The response typically includes data from the server, which the client can then use in its own applications or website.

To get your API key for OpenAI, you will need to visit the OpenAI platform website (https://platform.openai.com/overview) and log in to your account. Once you are logged in, you should be able to find the API key in your account settings. You can then copy the key and use it in your Rstudio project to access the OpenAI API and use GPT-3.

> store the API key


```r
Sys.setenv(OPENAI_API_KEY = "<APIKEY>")
# for example
# Sys.setenv(OPENAI_API_KEY = "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")

```


`Sys.setenv(OPENAI_API_KEY = "<APIKEY>")` is an R function that sets an environment variable in R. In this case, it is setting the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable to the API key for the OpenAI API.

Environment variables are a way to store and manage configuration settings in a program. By setting the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable, you can make the API key available to your R code without hard-coding it into your scripts. This makes it easier to manage your API key and to share your code with others without exposing your API key.

When you run the Sys.setenv function, it sets the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable to the API key that you specify in place of <APIKEY>. The openai package will then be able to access the API key from the environment variable, allowing you to make API requests to OpenAI.

##  install packages of MichelNivard


```r
install.packages("devtools")
require(devtools)
install_github("MichelNivard/gptstudio")
```

The code you provided, require(devtools); install_github("MichelNivard/gptstudio"), installs the gptstudio add-in for Rstudio. The devtools package is required to install packages from GitHub, and the install_github function is used to install the `gptstudio` package directly from the GitHub repository.

Once the `gptstudio` add-in is installed, you will be able to use it to start a GPT chat and perform other tasks using GPT-3 in Rstudio. Note that you will still need to set your OpenAI API key and install the openai package, as described earlier, in order to use the gptstudio add-in.


## let' start

The gptstudio add-in for Rstudio provides a convenient way to use GPT-3 for text generation and other natural language processing tasks directly from within Rstudio.

To use the gptstudio add-in, you will first need to have the gptstudio package installed, as described in the previous answer. Once the package is installed, you can open a R Markdown document in Rstudio (or any other text document) and write the text that you want to generate a response for.

Next, you can select the text that you want to use as the prompt for GPT-3 and then run the gptstudio add-in by selecting it from the Rstudio add-ins menu. The add-in will then send the selected text to the OpenAI API as a prompt, and the API will return a response generated by GPT-3.

The response from GPT-3 will be returned to your R code as a string, which you can then use in your R program or manipulate as desired. For example, you could use the response to generate additional text or to answer questions.
