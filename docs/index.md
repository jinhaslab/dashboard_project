Dear All,

<p class="in"> Welcome to the Public health Dashboard Creation Course! My name is Jinha Yoon and I will be your instructor for this course. I am a researcher and professor at Yonsei University College of Medicine, Department of Preventive Medicine, Institute of Occupational Health, and I have 10 years experience in the field of data analysis and visualization for public health.
<p>

In this course, we will explore the basics of R and Rstudio, the flexdashboard package, and Shiny. We will cover the various components of a dashboard, including visualizations, text, and interactivity, and we will learn how to create dynamic and interactive dashboards that allow users to explore data and drill down into specific details.

By the end of this course, you will have the skills and knowledge necessary to create effective dashboards using R, shiny and the flexdashboard package. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced R user, this course will provide you with a solid foundation for creating and sharing dashboards with others.

I am looking forward to working with all of you and helping you achieve your goals. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to me.

Best regards,
Jinha Yoon

## Prerequisite

Basic knowledge of R and the tidyverse package is a prerequisite for this course. The tidyverse package is a collection of R packages that provide a consistent and convenient interface for data manipulation, exploration, and visualization. In this course, we will use the tidyverse package to prepare and clean data, as well as to create visualizations.

It is recommended that students have a basic understanding of R syntax, data structures, and functions before enrolling in this course. If you are new to R, there are many online resources and tutorials available that can help you get started.

If you already have experience with R, but are new to the tidyverse package, it is recommended that you spend some time familiarizing yourself with the package and its various components. There are many resources available online, including tutorials and documentation, that can help you get started. I already make Data manipulation with R Course, that is related to tidyverse packages. 

Overall, having a solid understanding of R and the tidyverse package is essential for success in this course. I hope this information helps, and I look forward to seeing you in class!
